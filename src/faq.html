      <button class="faq__question">1. What is Jelbi?</button>
      <div class="faq__content">
        <p>
          Jelbi is a project run by the BVG in association with a number of
          partners. We offer, develop, and link up ways to get around in Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jelbi takes mobility beyond traditional public transport, for the
          first time bundling together public transport and shared services. All
          of them are conveniently linked up in a single app. From journey
          planning information to booking and payment. All in the Jelbi app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jelbi stations are the analogue twins of the digital app. They make it
          possible to flexibly book, use, and combine locally available services
          in the Jelbi app.
        </p>

      <button class="faq__question">3. How do I get the Jelbi app?</button>
      <div class="faq__content">
        <p>
          You can download the app from the AppStore (iOS) and the PlayStore
          (Android).
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="faq__heading">Getting started and sign-up</h2>
      <button class="faq__question">4. How do I create a user account?</button>
      <div class="faq__content">
        <p>
          Already have an account for the BVG Tickets app or the Fahrinfo app?
          Then you can simply sign in with the same email address and password
          you use for them..
        </p>
        <h3>OR</h3>
        <p>
          Sign up as a new user – enter your email address and choose a
          password. The BVG will then send you an email. Please click on the
          link in it and enter further required information in the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>your personal information.</li>
          <li>
            your mobile number; a text message with a 4-digit code will be sent
            to verify this number.
          </li>
          <li>payment method (credit card, SEPA direct debit, or PayPal)</li>
          <li>
            if you have a driving licence – verify your driving licence and ID
            card. This may take a few minutes – it’s best to do it before your
            first car or scooter ride.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
